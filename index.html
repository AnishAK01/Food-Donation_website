                <p>In spite of the remarkable economic growth and poverty reduction in India, the country has not
                    witnessed a commensurate improvement in its food and nutrition indicators.
                    Our analysis revels that the majority of the Indian states had either ‘alarming’ or ‘extremely
                    alarming’ levels of hunger in 2005-06.
